          "title": "Streamlining Customer Agreements & Boosting Satisfaction",
          "client": "A Medical SaaS Company",
          "challenge": "The company was spending a lot of money and time sending physical agreements to customers, which led to delays, mistakes, and poor customer satisfaction.",
          "solution": "We identified a misunderstanding of internal rules and guided the company to switch from physical mail to email for processing agreements. This required no new software and was implemented immediately.",
          "impact": "The change improved customer satisfaction and **cut the company's mailing costs by $20,000 to $30,000 annually**."

          "challenge": "A critical project to move customers to a new clearinghouse was chaotic, with no centralized workflow. The project was falling behind schedule, with a high volume of returned mail costing the company thousands.",
          "solution": "We took over the project and redesigned the entire workflow. This included creating a centralized, accessible spreadsheet for all customers, and automating communication via email and fax with clear instruction sheets.",
          "impact": "The project finished **3 months ahead of schedule**, and we successfully migrated **98%** of their customers to the new clearinghouse, far exceeding the initial goal of 70%."

          "solution": "After reviewing the processes, we developed a tool that now actively monitors their systems. This tool sends real-time email notifications to both technicians and clients whenever a problem is detected, including relevant logs.",
          "impact": "This solution eliminated the need for a constant on-call staff and drastically **improved customer satisfaction** by ensuring problems are addressed proactively."

          "solution": "We performed a full code and data audit. We verified that the data was not the issue and then located hardcoded, outdated information within the iOS code. This was a simple but critical bug that was impacting customer experience.",
          "impact": "By identifying the root cause, the engineering team was able to fix the issue, which led to a significant **reduction in support tickets** and helped the company **regain its customers' trust**."

          "title": "Automating Data Correction to Free Up Engineering Time",
          "client": "A Software Development Company",
          "challenge": "A company was missing critical data in their database, which was causing incorrect information in customer accounts. The support team had to constantly ask engineers to manually add the missing data, taking up valuable engineering time.",
          "solution": "We located a way for the system to automatically check for missing data. If data is missing, a new function is triggered that locates and loads the information without any human intervention.",
          "impact": "This solution now allows the support team to handle data issues on their own, **freeing up engineering resources** to focus on more complex, high-value tasks."

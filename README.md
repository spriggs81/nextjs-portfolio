# John Spriggs — Production-Focused Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.  
It highlights real-world production incidents, system investigations, and operational problem-solving work from my career in technical support and engineering-adjacent roles.

The goal of this site is simple:  
**demonstrate how I think, diagnose, and resolve complex production issues.**

## 🧠 What This Portfolio Emphasizes

- Production incident analysis
- Root cause investigation
- Data and log forensics
- System behavior under failure
- Preventative thinking and long-term fixes
- Ownership from first signal → resolution → monitoring

These are not hypothetical exercises — the case studies are based on real systems, real users, and real impact (with sensitive details anonymized).
